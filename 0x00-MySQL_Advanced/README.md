Use “container-on-demand” to run MySQL
Ask for container Ubuntu 18.04 - Python 3.7
Connect via SSH
Or via the WebTerminal
In the container, you should start MySQL before playing with it:
$ service mysql start
 * MySQL Community Server 5.7.30 is started
$
$ cat 0-list_databases.sql | mysql -uroot -p my_database
Enter password: 
Database
information_schema
mysql
performance_schema
sys
$
In the container, credentials are root/root

How to import a SQL dump
$ echo "CREATE DATABASE hbtn_0d_tvshows;" | mysql -uroot -p
